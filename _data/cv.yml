      institution: University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia
      year: 2024
      description:
        - Supervised by Prof. Saman Halgamuge, Prof. Sherene Loi, Dr. Peter Savas, and Dr. Jason Li.
        - title: Deep Neural Networks for Limited Data Scenarios
          contents:
            - Enhanced foundational research in few-shot learning by developing parameter-efficient fine-tuning approaches, achieving an average accuracy improvement up to 7.7\% over the state-of-the-art methods across 13 datasets.
            - Pioneered novel weakly-supervised training models for giga-pixel images, achieving upto 8\% classification improvement on held-out test data.
            - Developed a transformer based model for analysing kinematic time-series data, achieving up to 3\% improvement over the state-of-the-art methods.
