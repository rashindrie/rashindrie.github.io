I am a Senior Applied Scientist at [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/au/) based in Melbourne, working at the intersection of machine learning, data analytics, and real‑world impact. I currently work on building production-level AI pipelines for large-scale data sources. This work has securred the filing of two patents.

Over the past decade, my career has spanned academic research and industry, with a consistent focus on building trustworthy, data‑efficient neural network systems that translate into tangible benefits for healthcare and enterprise settings.

I hold a PhD in Engineering from the [University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/), where my doctoral work tackled core optimisation and generalisation challenges in training neural networks under low‑data constraints. This research led to publications in top‑tier venues such as IEEE/CVF CVPR (A\* CORE‑ranked) and Nature Communications Engineering.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
